Stealify Lang - Is an ECMAScript Inspired Polyglot  Language

Its main difference is that it does Compile down to whole Unikernels/CloudImages/Containers/AppImages and other virtual machines and also provides a Unified Compiler Feedback Interface to gather Metrics and Profiling as also Other Compiler Feedback while Running and While Building this allows you to KI Optimize your Already Deployed Applications while you code on them. Our default algo is bayesian. Because Fast Feedback while coding leads to faster Working Software!

The Project is Created by Frank Lemanschik after more than 15 years of research. All Self Financed because of my own needs while Freelancing as IT Consultant.

## Why?
Original Text: Frank Lemanschik 01.04.2022 - I was confident in coding since I was 10 years old but then I got the first customers and learned how hard it is to maintain code that is deployed elsewhere. I needed to address issues that I simply never got on my system or systems. With more and more years of experience, I found out where the Problem root is in the Whole Industrie I spoke to a lot of engineers of Organisations of all Sizes. From Google to Cloudflare to Microsoft over Oracle, I got them all. I followed Carefully everything they are doing and tried to see the why and how it is useful. I started to See my Self as a Stakeholder in some bigger Projects and tried to successfully influence them. As I did that I found out that I got Communication issues and I started to work on that.

As I got all covered I thought it is clever to teach others what I learned then I found out that does not Scale then I remembered IDE Tooling and Intellisense and Finally got the Final Vision I Put it together with what I learned from the Oracle GraalVM Project and throw all my old Concepts away! So the King is Dead (Stealify Patterns and tools) long live the King @stealify/stealify The Coding Lang that inheres most other coding langs + gives them new debug abilities.
