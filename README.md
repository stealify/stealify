Stealify Lang - Is a ECMAScript Inspired Polyglot  Language

Its main diffrence is that it does Compile down to whole Unikernels/CloudImages/Containers/AppImages and other virtualMachines as also provides a Unifed Compiler Feedback Interface to gather Metrics and Profiling as also Other Compiler Feedback while Running and While Building this allows you to KI Optimize your Already Deployed Applications while you code on them. Our default algo is bayesian. Because Fast Feedback while coding leads to faster Working Software!

The Project is Created by Frank Lemanschik after more then 15 years of research. All Self Financed because of own needs while Freelancing as IT Consultant. 

## Why?
Original Text: Frank Lemanschik 01.04.2022 - I was confident in coding since i was 10 years old but then i got the first customers and learned how hard it is to maintain code that is deployed else where. I needed to address issues that i simply never got on my own system or systems. With more and more years of Expirence i found out where the Problem root is in the Whole Industrie i spoke to a lot of engineers of Organisations of all Size. From Google to Cloudflare to Microsoft i got em all. I followed Carefully everything they are doing and tryed to see the why and how it is usefull. I started to See my Self as a Stake holder in some bigger Projects and tryed to successfully influence them. As i did that i found out that i got Communication issues and i started to work on that.

As i got all covered i tought it is clever to teach others what i learned then i found out that does not Scale then i remembered IDE Tooling and Intellisense and Finaly got the Final Vision i Putted it together with what i learned from the Oracle GraalVM Project and throw all my old Concepts away! So the King is Dead (Stealify Patterns and tools) long live the King @stealify/stealify The Coding Lang that inhires most other coding langs + gives them new debug abilitys.
